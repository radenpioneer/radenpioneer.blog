## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Conventions

`docs/agents/conventions.md` is how this codebase is written — components, islands, styling, the
layout and head seam, images, config, empty vs missing vs error, comments, and the build guards.
Every rule is marked hard or default. **Read it before writing or editing any code here.**

In short: site components are React (`.tsx`) with an `.astro` wrapper, one directory each, pages
only assemble, and nothing hydrates unless it has earned an `ISLAND:` header.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as gitignored markdown files under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` in this repo. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, used verbatim as the `Status:` value in each issue file. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
